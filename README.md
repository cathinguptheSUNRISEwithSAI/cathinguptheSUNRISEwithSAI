- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cathinguptheSUNRISEwithSAI
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm not an early riser as you can see with my username, it's catching up the sunrise. As a student, this only serves as a challenge since waking up early is not my thing. So, with me let's catch up the sunrise for 10 days straight.
- ðŸŒ» Add info: The title of this portfolio is " Endless New Beginnings "
